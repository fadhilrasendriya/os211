# Top 10 List of Week 05

1. [Thrashing?](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/t/thrash.htm)<br>
Thrashing in computing is an issue caused when virtual memory is in use.
Thrashing happens when too many processes compete for inadequate memory
resources. The most prominent reason is insufficient RAM or memory leakage.
If your computer happen to slow down it is possible that thrashing is the
culprit. To know what is thrashing, you must first be aware of swapping and
page fault.

2. [Swapping?](https://binaryterms.com/swapping-in-operating-system.html)<br>
Swapping is a form of memory management that stores memory in storage.
Typically used when computer runs out of RAM. This could make you have more
memory than your RAM capacity. Storage is however very slow in speed compared
to RAM.

3. [Page Fault?](https://techterms.com/definition/page_fault)<br>
Page faults happen when a program tries to access memory that is not stored in
physical RAM. It then notifies operating system and then uses secondary storage
as mean of storing memory called swaps. This greatly affects performance as
secondary storage is much slower than physical RAM. You should ~~download~~ buy
more RAM to reduce page fault side effects. 

4. [Handling Thrashing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/techniques-to-handle-thrashing/)<br>
Now that you know about thrashing you want to prevent thrashing as much as
possible. To limit the effect of thrashing we can use local replacement
algorithm. With Local replacement algorithm, if the process starts thrashing,
it cannot steal frames from another process and cause the latter to thrash as
well. There are techniques of thrash-handling in this link. 

5. [Using more than 4GB of ram in 32 bit machine](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1119278/why-does-a-32-bit-os-support-4-gb-of-ram)<br>
Virtual memory could make computer have more memory than available RAM. But not
in this case of 32 bit machine with more than 4GB of physical RAM. This is
because 32 bit have only 2^32 individual addresses which is 4GB. So when you
have more than 4GB of RAM installed, it is literally not accessible.

6. [More RAM More Speed](https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-id/000129805/how-random-access-memory-ram-affects-performance)<br>
We all know that ~~downloading~~ adding more RAM increases your pc speed. More
RAM equals more room for memory and more room for program running. Just make
sure if you are planning to use more than 4GB of RAM that your machine is 64
bit.

7. [Swap Partition in Windows](https://www.quora.com/Why-doesnt-Windows-have-a-swap-partition-like-Linux)<br>
When installing linux you have to manually add swap partition. As you can see
the same does not apply to windows. So why don't windows have swap partitions?
Windows do have swap files so it is configured automatically.

8. [Kernel Panic](https://searchdatacenter.techtarget.com/definition/kernel-panic)<br>
One of week 5 assignment is to set the lowest possible RAM allocation to make
the machine barely boots. You might stumble accross the word **kernel panic**
when booting with very low RAM. It is equivalent to the infamous Windows Blue
Screen Of Death (BSOD).

9. [What to Do When Kernel Panic](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/linux-kernel-panic)<br>
When kernel panic happens do not be panic yourself. The most obvious thing you
must do (in this case your virtual machines kernel panics) is to allocate more
RAM. That is not the only case though. Read this article to know more. 

10. [Windows Memory Compression](http://woshub.com/memory-compression-process-high-usage-windows-10/)<br>
The word **compressed** is seen in the performance tab in windows task
managers. Windows 10 has built-in memory compression feature. This feature
reduces the use of disk swapping and is significantly faster than disk
swapping.

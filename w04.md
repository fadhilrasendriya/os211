# Top 10 List of Week 04

1. [Buffer Overflow](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topic/ethical-hacking-buffer-overflow/)<br>
When taking external input, an application needs to allocate memory to store
that input. High-level programming languages will handle this with no problem.
But some low-level languages like C/C++ allow direct memory allocation using
**malloc**. A buffer overflow occur when the application tries to store more
data than the allocated memory. This can be exploited by a hacker to get the
program to execute malicious code. This is how it is done and how to mitigate it.


2. [Cheat Engine](https://superuser.com/questions/549041/how-does-a-software-like-cheat-engine-work)<br>
If you've used cheat engine you might be wondering how it is able to manipulate
memory of another process. Now that you know about **process isolation** and
maybe the concept of **virtual memory** it should not be possible to even
access memory not belong to the respective process. The answer turned out to be
simple because it is there are windows functions called ReadProcessMemory and
WriteProcessMemory.You may also call Cheat Engine as program debugger with
unconventional interface.

3. [Gameshark](https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/76858/how-do-gameshark-codes-work)<br>
Its not unsurprising how easy it is to cheat games in old systems. Now even
with modern systems with increased security and more improved anti-cheats,
People still able to find exploits. If you are curious how was it done check
this out.

4. [Still need SWAP?](https://haydenjames.io/linux-performance-almost-always-add-swap-space/)<br>
We know that swap use secondary storage as a mean of storing memory when
physical RAM runs out. Now that RAMs are getting cheaper and its becoming more
common for a machine to have at least 4GB of RAM do we still need swap? The
answer is yes. You never know when you will run out of memory. 

5. [Accessing Kernel Memory](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/176974/why-is-accessing-kernel-memory-a-security-risk)<br>
Accessing kernel memory can potentially cause meltdown. Meltdown is a hardware
vulnerability that allows rogue process to read all memory. Meltdown is
a bigger threat for cloud than home machine.

6. [Contigousness](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-contiguous-and-noncontiguous-memory-allocation/)<br>
Contiguous memory allocation assigns the consecutive blocks of memory to
a process requesting for memory. Noncontiguous memory allocation assigns the
separate memory blocks at a different location in memory space. Noncontiguous
allocation has slower performance because of more overheads.

7. [Buffer Overflow Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYrfWpkvMxA)<br>
This video gives a simple example of buffer overflow with kali linux. This is
a practical video meaning you don't have to watch a long explanation video.
Check this out.

8. [C struct in assembly](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/undergraduate/313/spring05/burt_katz/lectures/Lect10/structuresInAsm.html)<br>
This is how struct in C programming language converted into assembly language.
I know you probably get a PTSD hearing the word **assembly**. It's okay if this is too
much for you to handle don't click this link.

9. [Endianness](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13926760/the-reason-behind-endianness)<br>
Most modern systems use big-endian in their architecture. Some of the known
little-endian architectures is **AVR**. Ok please don't hate me for mentioning
**AVR**. This thread answers why there are 2 endians that it gave you troubles
in Computer Organization exam.

10. [c-pointer](https://resources.tasking.com/p/how-use-pointers-c-avoiding-errors-and-increasing-efficiency)<br>
If you are new to C then pointer must be new to you. Pointers are similiar to
reference in Java language except pointers point directly to memory
addresses. Pointers can be useful in C programming as C has limited functions
and features. Though pointer can be dangerous it is essential to master
C programming.

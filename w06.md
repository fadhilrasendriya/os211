# Top 10 List of Week 06

1. [Zombie Process](https://www.howtogeek.com/119815/htg-explains-what-is-a-zombie-process-on-linux/)<br>
A zombie process or defunct process is a process that has completed execution
but still has an entry in the process table. When a process ends via exit, all
of the memory and resources associated with it are deallocated so they can be
used by other processes. The parent can read the child's exit status by
executing the wait system call, whereupon the zombie is removed.

2. [Fork vs Thread](http://www.geekride.com/fork-forking-vs-threading-thread-linux-kernel/)<br>
The difference between forking and threading approaches is one of operating
system architecture. A forked process is called a heavy-weight process, whereas
a threaded process is called light-weight process. A forked process is
considered a child process whereas a threaded process is called a sibling.
Process switching requires the help of OS unlike thread switching.

3. [Fork Purpose](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/985051/what-is-the-purpose-of-fork)<br>
fork() is used to create child process. It is for this reason operating system
can do many things at the same time. Example is Google Chrome browser using
fork to handle each page with within seperate process. This prevents the whole
browser crashing when only one page crashes (also probably why it hogs so much
RAM). 

4. [Software Threads vs Hardware Threads](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5593328/software-threads-vs-hardware-threads)<br>
Multi-core processors have more physical threads. It is true parallel because
it is physically there. Whereas software threads are abstraction to the hardware to make
multi-processing possible. Software multi-threading can actually run in single
core (or single cpu thread) hence it is not true parallel. 

5. [Fork vs Exec](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-fork-exec/)<br>
Both fork and exec are ways to create new processes. The fork call basically
makes a duplicate of the current process. The exec call is a way to basically
replace the entire current process with a new program. It loads the program
into the current process space and runs it from the entry point.

6. [Context Switching](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-context-switching-in-operating-system)<br>
A context switch is the process of storing the state of a process or thread, so
that it can be restored and resume execution at a later point. This allows
multiple processes to share a CPU. It is essential feature for multitasking.
Context swtiching is however very expensive.

7. [Process Scheduling](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_process_scheduling.htm)<br>
Process Scheduling is an OS task that schedules processes of different states
like ready, waiting, and running. Process scheduling allows OS to allocate
a time interval of CPU execution for each process. Another important reason for
using a process scheduling system is that it keeps the CPU busy all the time.
This allows you to get the minimum response time for programs. Process
scheduling is an essential part of a Multiprogramming operating systems.

8. [Concurrency vs Parallelism](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1050222/what-is-the-difference-between-concurrency-and-parallelism)<br>
Concurrency means that an application is making progress on more than one task
at the same time. Concurrency means executing multiple tasks at the same time
but not necessarily simultaneously. Parallelism means that an application
splits its tasks up into smaller subtasks which can be processed in parallel.
Parallelism does not require two tasks to exist. It literally physically run
parts of tasks OR multiple tasks, at the same time using the multi-core
infrastructure of CPU.

9. [2 Threads 1 Core](https://forums.tomshardware.com/threads/why-is-cpu-hyperthreading-limited-to-2-threads-why-cant-amd-or-intel-make-it-4-8-or-10-threads-per-core.3388544/)<br>
The important part in hyperthreading is that the two logical processors share
the same Execution engine. The units that make up the core are not duplicated.
The gain of having more than 2 threads per core is not that much and its better
to use more cores.

10. [Core Allocation](https://superuser.com/questions/187566/does-os-allocate-each-process-to-a-separate-core)<br>
The OS cannot split an individual single-threaded process across multiple
cores. OS does not have the ability to determine which parts of the process are
OK to run in parallel and which are not.  If a program is not designed to run
on parallel cores, you can have routines within the application that are
designed to run sequentially running at the same time. This can cause all sorts
of issues.

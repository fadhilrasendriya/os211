# Top 10 List of Week 08

1. [CPU Burst](https://www.quora.com/What-is-meant-by-CPU-Burst-and-I-O-Burst)<br>
CPU burst is the amount of time the process uses the processor before it is no longer ready.
Every process in a computer system requires some amount of time for its execution. 
Burst time is the total time taken by the process for its execution on the CPU.

2. [CPU Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpu-scheduling-in-operating-systems/)<br>
CPU scheduling is a process that allows one process to use the CPU while the 
execution of another process is on hold(in waiting state) due to unavailability 
of any resource. CPU Scheduling makes the system efficient, fast, and fair.
Whenever the CPU becomes idle, the operating system must select one of the 
processes in the ready queue to be executed.

3. [Priority Scheduling](https://www.guru99.com/priority-scheduling-program.html)<br>
Priority scheduling is a method of scheduling processes based on priority.
In this method, the scheduler chooses the tasks to work as per the priority, 
which is different from other types of scheduling.
Priority scheduling involves priority assignment to every process, 
and processes with higher priorities are carried out first, whereas tasks 
with equal priorities are carried out on a first-come-first-served.

4. [Round Robin](https://www.guru99.com/round-robin-scheduling-example.html)<br>
The name of this algorithm comes from the round-robin principle. 
each person gets an equal share of something in turns.
To schedule processes fairly, a round-robin scheduler generally employs time-sharing, giving each job a time slot or quantum,
and interrupting the job if it is not completed by then.

5. [Shortest-Job First](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/shortest-job-first)<br>
Shortest Job First is an algorithm in which the process having the smallest execution time is chosen for the next execution.
This scheduling method can be preemptive or non-preemptive.
In non-preemptive scheduling, once the CPU cycle is allocated to process, the process holds it till it reaches a waiting state or terminated.
In Preemptive SJF Scheduling, jobs are put into the ready queue as they come.

6. [Multi-Processor Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multiple-processor-scheduling-in-operating-system/)<br>
Load Balancing is the phenomena which keeps the workload evenly distributed across all processors.
A loosely coupled multiprocessor system contains multiple processors which have their own local memories.
The load balancing scheme is formulated as a nonlinear programming problem with linear constraints.

7. [NUMA Awareness](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/sdk-java-technology/7?topic=bgcp-numa-awareness)<br>
Non-uniform memory access (NUMA) is a computer memory design used in multiprocessing, where the memory access time depends on the memory location relative to the processor.
NUMA architectures logically follow in scaling from symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) architectures.
The Balanced Garbage Collection policy can split the Java heap across NUMA nodes in a system. Application threads are segregated such that each thread has a node where the thread runs and favors the allocation of objects.

8. [WGET Hanging](https://serverfault.com/questions/290315/why-is-wget-hanging)<br>
For those who had problems in using wget to download package for lfs this may help you
(which in my case didn't). I also maybe the only one who had this problem. Also I solved 
this problem by downloading all the package to my windows machine and scp to my vm.

9. [Why LFS](https://www.quora.com/Why-should-anyone-build-Linux-from-scratch)<br>
If you're wondering why bother building lfs (you're not the only one) read this thread.
Many distros are shipped with many softwares/libraries which you may never use in your lifetime.
Building Linux from Scratch , gives you freedom to choose what libraries and binaries you include as part of your own distro.
It is also great to learn about linux.

10. [Change Process Priority Windows 10](https://winaero.com/change-process-priority-windows-10/)<br>
There is a way to change priority in windows 10. Keep in mind that if you decide
to do it do it at your own risk. Or you can buy ssd.

# Top 10 List of Week 07

1. [Semaphore](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/semaphores-in-process-synchronization/)<br>
The website gives good explanations about semaphores in process
synchronization. There are code examples and illustrations in the website so we
can understand the topics better. Semaphore is simply a variable which is
non-negative and shared between threads. This variable is used to solve the
critical section problem and to achieve process synchronization in the
multiprocessing environment.

2. [POSIX Semaphores](http://www.csc.villanova.edu/~mdamian/threads/posixsem.html)<br>
The website provides some kind of a tutorial on implementing POSIX semaphores.
It gives examples and also explanations on POSIX semaphore functions. Tutorial
often gives better understandable method of studying.

3. [Thread Signaling](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-concurrency/thread-signaling.html)<br>
The purpose of thread signaling is to enable threads to send signals to each
other. Additionally, thread signaling enables threads to wait for signals from
other threads. For instance, a thread B might wait for a signal from thread
A indicating that data is ready to be processed.

4. [Critical Section](https://www.guru99.com/process-synchronization.html)<br>
The webiste mainly explains about process synchronization and critical section
problem. The discussed topics: what process synchronization is, how process
synchronization works, sections of a program, what critical section problem is,
rules and solutions to critical section problem.

5. [Deadlock Prevention](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-deadlock-prevention)<br>
eadlock prevention algorithms are used in concurrent programming when multiple
processes must acquire more than one shared resource. If two or more concurrent
processes obtain multiple resources indiscriminately, a situation can occur
where each process has a resource needed by another process. As a result, none
of the processes can obtain all the resources it needs, so all processes are
blocked from further execution. This situation is called a deadlock. A deadlock
prevention algorithm organizes resource usage by each process to ensure that at
least one process is always able to get all the resources it needs.

6. [Deadlock Example](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/a7128j/interviewer_explain_deadlock_and_well_hire_you/)<br>
This is an example of deadlock in the form of job interview. The interview does
not end. You should understand how much of a threat a deadlock is.

7. [Exitting a deadlock](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/126657/exit-a-deadlock-cycle)<br>
You don't. There saying *Prevention is better than cure* but in this case there
is absolutely no cure. All you have to do is prevent deadlocks happening as
best as possible.

8. [Livelock](https://www.guru99.com/what-is-livelock-example.html)<br>
When there is 'Dead' there should be 'Live'. Livelock is a situation where
a request for an exclusive lock is denied repeatedly, as many overlapping
shared locks keep on interfering each other. The processes keep on changing
their status, which further prevents them from completing the task. This
further prevents them from completing the task. 

9. [Banker's Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bankers-algorithm-in-operating-system-2/)<br>
The Banker algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm
developed by Edsger Dijkstra. It tests for safety by simulating the allocation
of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an
"s-state" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending
activities. Some of the resources that are tracked in real systems are memory,
semaphores and interface access.

10. [Cooperating Process](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cooperating-process)<br>
A cooperating process is one that can affect or be affected by other processes
running on the system. Cooperating processes can either directly share
a logical address space or be allowed to share data only through shared memory
or message passing. This is what leads to the infamous deadlock.
